GPT-2 Powered Chatbot with Tkinter GUI and Voice Interaction
Project Overview
Welcome to the GPT-2 Chatbot Project! ðŸš€ This project features multiple chatbot implementations that highlight how AI-powered conversation can go beyond text, bringing in voice and interactive GUIs.

Whether youâ€™re a beginner exploring AI chatbots or an experienced developer looking to experiment with GPT-2, this project has something for you:

1.Text-Based Chatbot â€“ A simple command-line chatbot that generates text-based responses.
2.Math Expression Evaluation â€“ A chatbot that not only chats but also solves basic math problems! ðŸ§®
3.Voice-Enabled Chatbot â€“ Speak to the bot and hear it talk back using voice recognition and text-to-speech (TTS). ðŸŽ™
4.GUI Chatbot â€“ An interactive chatbot with a Tkinter-based user interface, featuring input fields, buttons, and a scrollable chat history. ðŸ–¥

Features
ðŸ¤– AI-Generated Responses: The GPT-2 chatbot generates conversational responses using Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers.
ðŸ§© Math Solver: Ask the bot to evaluate simple mathematical expressions.
ðŸŽ¤ Voice Interaction: Use speech commands and get voice-based replies.
ðŸ–± Graphical Interface: Chat through an intuitive Tkinter GUI with easy-to-use controls.

Getting Started-Installation
Before running the chatbot, install the required libraries. You can do this with a single command:
